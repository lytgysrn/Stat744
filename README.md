# Stat744

I think this graph is not good.
The reasons are list below:

**1**: It seems that the data set has some missing values for some cities (e.g. QUE in 2000), this graph directly leaves it as blank, which may confuse readers (missing value or 0 value).
**2** It is difficult to know the data precision from this line graph, because it does not show all exact data points in this graph. Data points by year or by month are likely to give different results. Moreove, if some algorithms are applied to smooth data in this graph, the title should give a brief introduction.
**3** This graph distinguishes different cities by colors, and even uses many similar colars (e.g.QUE and CGY, EDM and VIC). This is not appropriate, especially, it does not consider people with colour weakness at all.


By the way, I also want to say a good point.
It gives Candian average level of traffic violations causing death (rate per 100,000 population)to compare with canadian cities levels, it may be helpful for later analyses.
And it is very interesting to see the Canadian average level is more flat than majority cities (maybe because of law of large numbers).
