  One possible project is about creating an interactive map, and further using other visualization techniques to explore properties of
events in this map. As an example, we may consider the earthquake data set from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/usgs/earthquake-database).
With the information of Latitude and Longitude, it is easy for us to convert the data set to a map. Besides, we can also build a 
statistical model to analyze magnitudes of earthquake, hence some plots about statistical inference can be generated. Furthermore, 
we may apply choropleth mapping or cartograms for stressing the geometric distributions of earthquake. For one specific region, we can draw 
the time series plot to illustrate whether earthquakes are naturally clustered in time.
